When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When using multiple computers to work on the same project.
    Collaborate with other devs.
    Acts as backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some changes done locally might be lost if working on the same branch and it gets pulled from remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone creates copies of repositories. Used to create a copy on the local machine.
    Forks are like clones but its done on Github and tracks the original repo which it was created from. Used to copy another persons
    repo to work with but not touch the original code.
    Branches are created within a repo. This is used when experimenting with a new
    feature or fixing a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Its possible to work offline with access to all changes on the remote being available on the local repo.
